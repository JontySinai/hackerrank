A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Two marbles are drawn without replacement. 

If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

P(second blue | first red) = P(blue and red)/P(red)
                           = (P(second blue)*P(first red))/P(first red)
                           = P(second blue)
                           = 4/6
                           = 2/3
